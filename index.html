        Gun Recommendation For Beginners
    </h1>

    <h2>
        <p class="title-1">The Smith and Wesson XD 9mm </p> 
        <p class="text-1">This gun is great for beginners. It's cheaper than a Glock but just of useful and comes with just as many attachments and aftermarket gear.
        The trigger is something that I'm not extremely excited about but it does get the job done and reset is extremely smooth making rapid fire shooting much easier.</p>
